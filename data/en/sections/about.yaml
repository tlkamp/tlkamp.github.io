summary: |
  I am a passionate software engineer with 8 years of industry experience. I mostly build backend services for the cloud, on AWS or GCP.

  Sometimes I build silly things like `mockbob`, or work on frontend projects when I want something different.

  Outside work I like to read and play video games. I also like to budget and I'm passionate about taking control of my personal finances.
